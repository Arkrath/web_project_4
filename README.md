# Project Description
The aim for this project was to provide a interactive user-experience with an ability to personalise their settings. The main purpose was to provide the user a means to upload images of their journey around the  U.S.

# Techniques & Technologies
For the core layout a use of grid is fundamental in the design. The flexibility and responsive nature of grid makes this technology the perfect tool to embed the images in an organised fashion.
However, for user interaction, JavaScript was implemented to supply the user with an ability to edit their name and a brief description. This was achieved through utilizing DOM technology and simple classList functions to generate a smooth user-friendly system.

Further user functionality will be added later.
